***** INFO *****

Test source data is read from two directories in this (where this file is) directory.

Small, text-format files are placed in:
/small-text-files/

Larger, binary-format files are placed in:
/large-binary-files/

They are used for different types of tests, and are to be considered different collections.
The output from these tests is found in, relative to the test project root namespace:

/test-data-dst/small-text-files/
/test-data-dst/large-binary-files/

and

/test-data-dst/package-output/
